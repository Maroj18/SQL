# For this project I first downloaded the database chinook.
# I then uploaded the data tables into SQLite.
# From there I analized the data then came up with these questions and wrote queries to answer them.

#Show Customers (their full names, customer ID) who are from canada.
SELECT 
FirstName, LastName, customerid
FROM customers
WHERE Country = 'Canada'

#Show all the Jazz tracks
SELECT 
tracks.Name, genres.Name
FROM tracks
LEFT JOIN genres
ON tracks.GenreId = genres.GenreId
WHERE genres.Name = 'Jazz'

#Count all the invoices from 2009
SELECT 
Count (InvoiceDate)
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'

# How many employees are sales agents?
SELECT COUNT(title) AS 'Number of Sales Agents'
FROM employees
WHERE title = 'Sales Support Agent'

# How many sales did support rep 5 make?
SELECT SUM(invoices.customerId), customers.SupportRepId
FROM invoices
LEFT JOIN customers
ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.CustomerId
WHERE customers.SupportRepId = 5

# Show the customers last name and their purchase total
